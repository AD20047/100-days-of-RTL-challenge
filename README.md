# 100DAYSOFRTL

Register Transfer Language (RTL) is a low-level language that is used to describe the functioning of a digital circuit and, more specifically, the transfer of information between registers. It provides how data moves from one register to the other and how data is processed within the digital system. Through RTL, there is a capability of creating abstraction levels where high-level design descriptions can be created and easily linked to low-level hardware implementation in designing, simulating, as well as synthesizing digital circuits.
